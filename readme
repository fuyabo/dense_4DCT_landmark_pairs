DIRLAB 4DCT lung images were used. Please refer to www.dir-lab.com  and the references papers for more details.

improved_dirlab_landmark_pairs folder contains improved dirlab 300 landmark pairs. Only part of the dirlab landmarks were improved. The remaining were unchanged.
dense_landmark_pairs folder contains new dense landmark pairs, 


EE represents End-Exhalation phase
EI represents End-Inhalation phase
