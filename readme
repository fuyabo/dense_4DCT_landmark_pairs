DIRLAB 4DCT lung images were used. Please refer to www.dir-lab.com  and the references papers for more details.

A. improved_dirlab_landmark_pairs folder contains 
    1. improved dirlab 300 landmark pairs. Only part of the dirlab landmarks were improved. The remaining were unchanged.
    2. see pdf files for visual comparison between landmark pairs before and after refinements.
B. dense_landmark_pairs folder contains 
    1. new dense landmark pairs, 
    2. see pdf files for some randomly selected landmark pairs

Note:
  1. Only landmark pair datasets were shared here. Please go to www.dir-lab.com to download original 4DCT datasets.
  2. When use this datasets, note that the first dimension and second dimention were swapped [y, x, z] compared to original DirLab landmark pairs [x, y, z].
  EE represents End-Exhalation phase
  EI represents End-Inhalation phase
